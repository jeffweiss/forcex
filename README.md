[![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/forcex.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/forcex)

Elixir library for interacting with the Force.com REST API.

## Usage

Add Forcex to your dependency list
```elixir
  defp deps do
    [ {:forcex, "~> 0.4"}
    ]
  end
```

At compile time Forcex will query the Force.com REST API and generate modules for all the
SObjects you have configured and permission to see.

If you see a warning like
```elixir
23:37:02.057 [warn]  Cannot log into SFDC API. Please ensure you have Forcex properly configured.
Got error code 400 and message %{"error" => "invalid_client_id", "error_description" => "client identifier invalid"}
```

You will need to configure Forcex, as noted below, and then explicitly recompile Forcex

```shell
$ mix deps.clean forcex
$ mix deps.compile forcex
```

You can have Forcex generate modules at compile time using the accompanying Mix task.

```shell
$ mix compile.forcex
```

This can also be invoked automatically by adding Forcex to your project's compilers in `mix.exs`

```elixir
compilers: [:forcex] ++ Mix.compilers,
```

## Configuration

The `Forcex.Client` is configured to read login information either from
application configuration:

```elixir

config :forcex, Forcex.Client,
  username: "user@example.com",
  password: "my_super_secret_password",
  security_token: "EMAILED_FROM_SALESFORCE",
  client_id: "CONNECTED_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID",
  client_secret: "CONNECTED_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET",
  endpoint: "https://test.salesforce.com",
  modules: ["People"]
```

or these environment variables:

* `SALESFORCE_USERNAME`
* `SALESFORCE_PASSWORD`
* `SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN`
* `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID`
* `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET`

The endpoint (defaults to `https://login.salesforce.com`) and modules configurations are optional. The list of modules can be specified so that only particular Salesforce Objects are compiled instead of compiling entire Salesforce object. 

HTTPoison request-specific options may also be configured:

```elixir
config :forcex, :request_options,
  timeout: 20000,
  recv_timeout: :infinity
```

For steps on how to create a Connected App with OAuth keys and secrets,
please see the [Force.com REST API section on Connected Apps](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_defining_remote_access_applications.htm).

Currently, to be fully functional, the `Forcex.Client` must both `login` and
`locate_services`.

Pagination of results is entirely manual at the moment.

```elixir
client = Forcex.Client.login |> Forcex.Client.locate_services

first_page = Forcex.query("select Id, Name from Account order by CreatedDate desc", client)

second_page = first_page |> Map.get("nextRecordsUrl") |> Forcex.get(client)
```

## Further Configuration

Forcex allows additional configuration of API endpoint and API version via the
`%Forcex.Client{}` struct. You may also use this mechanism if you have a
`grant_type` other than password.

This example shows how to use both an older API version and the SalesForce
sandbox API.
```elixir
Forcex.Client.default_config
|> Forcex.Client.login(%Forcex.Client{endpoint: "https://test.salesforce.com", api_version: "34.0"})
```
